     <h3>What are your expectations in ICT 9? <br>
     	<p> I feel like it would be a fun experience because we are learning coding and I've wanted to try coding for quite some time. </p>
     	<p> I'm expecting it to be hard because coding seems difficult. </p>
     	<p> I've heard from other friends that coding is a very complicated thing but by doing this activty, It seems bearable to do. </p>
